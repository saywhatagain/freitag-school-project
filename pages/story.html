     <p class="GrandTitre">History of the Unique FREITAG Bag    </p>
     <p class="TexteContent"> Back in 1993, graphic designer brothers Markus and Daniel Freitag were on the lookout for a messenger bag. Zurich citizens worthy of the name travel by bicycle - 'velo,' they call it. When it rains, they get wet. The FREITAG brothers wanted a heavy-duty, functional and water-repellent bag to carry their designs. Inspired by the cheerfully coloured lorries rumbling along the cross-Zurich highway just in front of their flat, they cut a messenger bag out of an old truck tarpaulin. </p>

  <p class="GrandTitre">First FREITAG bag      </p>
     <p class="TexteContent"> As luck would have it, their personal need turned into a business which now employs more than 130 people. Since their original messenger bag, the FREITAG brothers have developed and marketed several bags for women and men. FREITAG produces two bag lines: The classic FUNDAMENTALS with around 40 models, that are constantly being developed further and complemented and since September 2010 the new FREITAG REFERENCE Line with around 10 models. </p>
